Madden NFL 08

Madden NFL 08 is the 2008 edition of the American football video game series published by EA Sports and developed by EA Tiburon. It is the 19th installment in the Madden NFL video game franchise. It features the former Titans star quarterback Vince Young on the cover. San Diego Chargers defensive end Luis Castillo was the cover athlete for the Spanish language version. This was the first Madden game released (on August 14, 2007) for ten different platforms; including Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, Nintendo DS, PlayStation Portable, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube, and PC. This is the last version of Madden to be released for the PC, and Madden NFL 08 would also eventually become the last GameCube game produced and released in North America.

EA and Apple Inc. had announced in June 2007 that a version for Mac OS X would be released at the same time as the other versions. After the August 14 release date came and went without a Mac release, however, EA said it would be delayed until September or October 2007. A Spanish language version of the game was released on December 11, 2007 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 platforms. As of December 13, 2007, the Xbox 360 version has sold 1,069,576 copies in the United States. Madden NFL 08 has sold 4.5 million copies. It is also the last of the games in the Madden series to include all 6 NFL Europa teams.
